The Arduino is a Pro Micro.


# TMS-DMS-CMS-RDRswitches

Falcon BMS 4.35 specific.


Top Row:   Radar Cursors, left, up, down, right.

2nd Row:   CMS              "    "    "     "  .

3rd Row:   DMS              "    "    "     "  .

Bottom Row:TMS              "    "    "     "  .



Resistors are 125ohm and 1/8 watt.

It is basically a straight line for the 4 pins and 4 resistors.

Yah, not all of us have money for the Saitek X52 series.

Skyblast one for me, in the transistor world.
